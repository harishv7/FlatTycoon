# Prosper

Prosper stands for Property Resale Price Forecaster.

It is essentially an application that can predict the future resale value of your flat (in Singapore)! Sounds exciting? 

We have combined the power of Mircosoft Azure's Machine Learning capabilities together with the resale flat data from http://data.gov.sg to utilise over 15 years of data and 480,000 data points for an astonishing 95% (error margin of +-5%) accuracy in prediction of the price.

As a pro analytics feature, Prosper also provides a suggestion on when you should be selling your flat based on your expected annual growth rate of the flat price. Hence, the application tries to maximise your profit given the expected growth price per annum.

This application runs using Java and you can download it from the [Releases](https://github.com/harishv7/Prosper/releases) page. 

Prosper was developed in *24 hours* in the National University of Singapore (NUS) Data Science Student Challenge supported by Mircosoft.

Prosper managed to secure a *top 6* place among dozens of teams at NUS Data Science Student Challenge 2016.
